## Log

### 0.1 Baseline: database, contract, checks

Done 2026-11-07, on `i18n/0.1` (unattended run, wave 0).

Built:
- `migrations/00029_language.sql`: the enum `language` (the ten tags, staff languages first);
  `account.language` and `account.detected_language` (nullable); `organization.default_language` (not null,
  default `bs`, check: a staff language); `questionnaire.language` (not null, default `bs`, backfilled from the
  clinic's default); `questionnaire_translation` (primary key `questionnaire_id, language`, `texts jsonb`
  object, on delete cascade), row-level secured through `questionnaire` (each scope reads the translations of
  the versions it sees; only the clinic scope writes, only a draft's); `questionnaire_response.language`
  (nullable). Grants to `salus_app`; `questionnaire_translation` in `ownership.yaml` (owner `questionnaire`,
  `personal_data: false`). Tests: `migrations/language_test.go`.
- Go models and sqlc queries for the new columns, with repository tests: `auth.Account.Language`,
  `.DetectedLanguage`, `Repository.SetLanguage`, `.SetDetectedLanguage` (Create stores both);
  `organization.Organization.DefaultLanguage`, `Changes.DefaultLanguage` (read everywhere, written by Update);
  `questionnaire.Questionnaire.Language`, `Content.Language`, `.Translations`, `Translation`,
  `ItemTranslation`, `Repository.Translations`, `.PutTranslations` (Create, UpdateDraft and CreateVersion
  carry the language; CreateVersion copies the translations); `questionnaireresponse.Response.Language`,
  `Repository.SetLanguage`. No service or handler behaviour (wave 1). The test fakes implement the new port
  methods. Every domain's generated `models.go` gains the `Language` enum type (sqlc emits the schema's enums
  in every package).
- `api/openapi.yaml`: `Language` schema; `language` and `detectedLanguage` on `RegisterRequest`,
  `LoginRequest` and `AcceptInviteRequest`; `language` on `Account`; `PATCH /auth/me` (`updateMe`,
  `UpdateMeRequest {language: Language | null}`, 422 `language_unavailable`); `language` and `translations`
  (`QuestionnaireTranslation`, `QuestionnaireItemTranslation`) on `SaveQuestionnaireRequest` and
  `Questionnaire`; publish 422 `translation_incomplete` (`language`, `linkIds`);
  `POST /questionnaire-responses/{id}/start` (`startQuestionnaire`, `StartQuestionnaireRequest`, 409
  `language_locked`, 422 `language_unavailable`); `language` on `QuestionnaireResponse`; the error codes
  `language_unavailable`, `language_locked`, `translation_incomplete` and the error's `language`. Clients
  regenerated (`web/src/api/schema.d.ts`, `mobile/packages/salus_api`).
- `scripts/i18n-check.sh` (in the node service) running `scripts/i18n-check.mjs` and its tests
  (`scripts/i18n-check.test.mjs`, `node --test`): web areas against `en.json` (both value shapes, the legal
  tag compared), ARB files against `app_en.arb` (eleven files, `app_sr.arb` equal to `app_sr_Cyrl.arb`),
  e-mail template folders against `en/` (the same files and `{{…}}` fields); keys, ICU validity, placeholders
  and CLDR plural categories (`Intl.PluralRules`). Folders that don't exist yet are skipped. `make
  i18n-check`, a prerequisite of `make web-lint`, `make mobile-analyze` and `make lint`; the web and mobile CI
  path filters include the script.
- CLAUDE.md "Languages" section and `make i18n-check` under "Checks"; `docs/i18n/TRANSLATIONS.md`.

Test first (the failures seen):
- migrations: `language_test.go:22: ERROR: type "language" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42704)`, and the like for
  every column and table.
- auth: `a.Language undefined (type auth.Account has no field or method Language)`, `repo.SetLanguage
  undefined`. organization: `unknown field DefaultLanguage in struct literal of type
  organization.Organization`. questionnaire: `unknown field Language in struct literal of type
  questionnaire.Questionnaire`, `undefined: questionnaire.Translation`.
- questionnaireresponse: written together with its implementation; seen failing afterwards by removing the
  query's guard (`AND answers = '[]' AND attachments = '[]'`): `TestPostgres_SetLanguageWhileNothingIsAnswered`
  FAIL (the language changed after an answer was saved); guard restored, green.
- i18n-check: the test file run before the checker existed (module not found), then three failures on the
  first draft (a missing file crashed the comparison, placeholders compared wrongly, `it`/`fr` "many").

Checks:
- `go test -count=1 -cover` on `./migrations/`, `./internal/auth/`, `./internal/organization/`,
  `./internal/questionnaire/`, `./internal/questionnaireresponse/`: pass; coverage auth 95.7%, organization
  95.9%, questionnaire 94.3%, questionnaireresponse 93.6%. `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...`: pass.
- lint (`scripts/lint.sh`, `--no-deps`, the main checkout's `.git` mounted): pass, 0 issues; check-migrations
  ok. archcheck: pass.
- Clients: `gen:api` and the Dart generator with `dart format`, run twice: the second run leaves no diff.
- Catalogs: `bash ../scripts/i18n-check.sh` in the node service: 8 tests pass, "catalogs pass" (no catalogs on
  this branch). The same check over 0.2's and 0.3's committed catalogs (exported read-only with
  `git archive`): no problem.
- Not in the package's set, run because the clients changed: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` in web (434
  tests pass), `flutter analyze` in mobile (no issues).
- `make test`, `make cover`, `make fhir-validate` and `make e2e` are left to the integration step (RUN-RULES).

Decided while the owner was away:
- **Clinic settings are FHIR, so `defaultLanguage` is not in `openapi.yaml`.** The clinic settings screen
  reads and updates `Organization` through FHIR (`PUT /fhir/R4/Organization/{id}` with `If-Match`), like the
  listing and the time zone, which are the extensions `organization-listed` and `organization-timezone`. The
  default language follows them as the extension
  `https://salus.invalid/fhir/StructureDefinition/organization-default-language` (`valueCode`, a staff tag),
  for package 1.2 to map in its `handler_fhir.go`. Not `Organization.language`: that is the language the
  resource is written in, not the clinic's choice.
- **The patient's questionnaire and the response are read through FHIR**, so `languages` on the patient's
  read is not a JSON field: the app derives them from `Questionnaire.language` and the `translation`
  extensions (package 1.4), and the response read carries `QuestionnaireResponse.language` (2.1). The JSON
  `Questionnaire` (what the builder's writes return) and `QuestionnaireResponse` (what the answer writes
  return) gain `language`, and the questionnaire `translations`.
- **Starting a response is a new endpoint, `POST /questionnaire-responses/{id}/start`** `{language}`: no
  endpoint started a response before. It may be repeated with another language until the first answer or
  file is saved; after that it answers 409 `language_locked`, a third new error code the plan did not list,
  added so 2.1 needs no contract change. The query enforces it too (no change once `answers` or
  `attachments` is not empty), and it moves the response to its next version.
- **Invite acceptance takes `language` and `detectedLanguage` too**, as registration and sign-in do: it
  creates the staff account (SPEC §3 "Picking and saving" names the invite screens).
- **`questionnaire.language` has the column default `bs`**, and the create query falls back to it when no
  language is given, so the existing service and every seeded test keep working until 1.4 passes the
  clinic's default; `UpdateDraft` with no language keeps the draft's. The backfill from the clinic's default
  runs in the migration (every clinic is `bs` at that point).
- **No database check on `account.language`**: the SPEC puts the staff-language rule in the service (422
  `language_unavailable`); the clinic's default language has the check the plan asks for.
- **`questionnaire_translation` writes go through `questionnaire`'s own policies** (an EXISTS on a draft), so
  a published version's translations never change and another clinic's are invisible; a deleted draft's go
  by the cascade.
- **Translations are read with their own repository call**, not with every questionnaire read, so searches
  stay one query.
- **The catalog check accepts French and Italian plurals without `many`**: CLDR gives them `many` only for
  millions in compact or exponent form, which the apps never format; a message may still have it. Every other
  category CLDR lists for a language is required, and one the language doesn't use is refused.
- **The legal tag is compared across languages only in the web catalogs**; ARB metadata lives in the template
  (`app_en.arb`) alone.
- **The checker loads the ICU parser from `web/node_modules`** (react-intl brings it, 0.2), only when there is
  a message to check; `make i18n-check` installs web first. This branch alone has no react-intl, so the
  parser was installed with `npm install --no-save` to run the checker's tests (git-ignored
  `web/node_modules`; nothing committed).

COPY.md additions (not yet reviewed): none (no user-facing text in this package).

### 0.2 Web: i18n foundation

Done 2026-11-07 on `i18n/0.2`.

Built, all in `web/src/i18n/`:
- `languages.ts`: the five staff languages and `matchLanguage` (SPEC §3 "Matching", narrowed to what the web
  offers; `de`, `ar`, `tr`, `it`, `fr` are skipped; no match gives `bs`).
- `saved.ts`: the choice kept on the device (`localStorage` key `salus.language`, every access in try/catch,
  a value that is not a staff language is ignored), `startLanguage` (saved, else the browser's).
- `format.ts`: `formatTime` (24-hour), `formatDate` (`long`, `short`), `formatNumber`, all with Latin digits
  (`-u-nu-latn`); `intlLocale` maps `en` to `en-GB` and Serbian to CLDR's `sr-Latn-BA` / `sr-Cyrl-BA`.
- `catalog.ts`: every `<area>/<language>.json` loaded with `import.meta.glob`; `messagesFor` prefixes each key
  with its area (`shell.signOut`) and falls back to English for a missing key.
- `I18nProvider.tsx` (react-intl `IntlProvider` plus the language context; sets `<html lang>`; `onError`
  logs nothing), `useT.ts` (`useT`, `useLanguage` with `choose(language | null)`, `useFormat`),
  `renderInLanguage.tsx` (test helper with the real catalogs).
- An empty `{}` catalog for each area (`shell`, `auth`, `calendar`, `admin`, `questionnaire`, `consultation`,
  `attachments`, `common`) and each staff language: 40 files.
- `web/src/main.tsx` wraps `App` in the provider, starting in `startLanguage(navigator.languages)`.

Dependencies: `react-intl` 12.1.5, exact (12.1.6 was 11 days old; 12.1.5 is the newest older than two weeks).
It brings `@formatjs/intl` 6.1.4, `intl-messageformat` 12.1.4 and `@formatjs/icu-messageformat-parser` 3.5.22
(the parser 0.1's `scripts/i18n-check.sh` needs) at the exact versions react-intl pins. No other dependency.

Test first (failures seen before the code):
- module not found for the five new test files, then with stubs: `AssertionError: expected 'bs' to be 'hr'`
  (matching), `expected 'bs' to be null` (saved choice), `expected '' to be '15:05'` (time), `expected [] to
  deeply equal [ Array(8) ]` (areas), `expected undefined to be 'Settings'` (English fallback);
  `TypeError: startLanguage is not a function`. The Serbian ijekavian date was seen ekavian
  (`понедељак`) with `sr-Cyrl` before the `sr-Cyrl-BA` mapping.

Checks (each through `docker compose … run --rm --no-deps -T node`):
- `npm run lint` (oxlint): 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `npm run typecheck`: clean.
- `npm test`: 29 files, 481 tests passed (47 new in `src/i18n/`).
- `npm run build`: built; the single chunk is 986.45 kB (278.12 kB gzip), with Vite's existing over-500 kB
  warning.
- Catalogs: `scripts/i18n-check.sh` does not exist on this branch (0.1 adds it in the same wave); not run.
  The files keep SPEC §3's layout, `web/src/i18n/<area>/<language>.json`, each `{}`, so the check passes on
  them once 0.1 is merged.

Decided while the owner was away:
- Message ids are `<area>.<key>`: the provider prefixes each key with its area folder, so two areas can use
  the same key and a catalog file holds plain keys. Simplest way to merge eight areas into one react-intl map.
- A catalog value is an ICU string, or `{ "defaultMessage": "…", "description": "legal" }` when it carries the
  `legal` tag (SPEC §3 "Who translates": "a `description` in the web JSON"). Both shapes are read; 0.1's check
  should accept both (it runs on empty files in wave 0).
- Formatting locales: `en` is formatted as `en-GB` (day before month, as the app wrote dates before), Serbian as
  `sr-Latn-BA` / `sr-Cyrl-BA` so dates are ijekavian (SPEC §3 "Serbian is ijekavian"; plain `sr` is ekavian
  in CLDR). Intl's own punctuation is kept ("Monday, 9 November 2026"), not post-processed.
- Signed-in saving (`PATCH /auth/me`) and applying the account's `language` after `/auth/me` belong to 1.5
  (the picker); `useLanguage().choose` switches the UI and keeps the choice on the device, and 1.5 calls the
  API beside it. No generated API client is used in 0.2.
- `<html lang>` is set from the provider at runtime; `web/index.html` (not this package's file) keeps
  `lang="en"` until the script runs.

COPY.md additions (not yet reviewed): none (0.2 adds no user-facing text; the catalogs are empty).
